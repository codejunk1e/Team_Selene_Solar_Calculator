# Team_Selene_Solar_Calculator
Solar Calculator (mobile) A page that allows you calculate how much solar power you need to run your home  `Features` 1. User visits the page 2. Enters details of electronics 3. App calculates how much solar power is needed to run the electronics
<p><h2>Here's the algorithm/calculations adopted..</h2></p>
<p><b>Watt</b> = Voltage * Amps 
<p><b>Total watt needed for device</b> = (Voltage) * (Amps) * (Hours Used daily)
<p><b>Battery size(AH)</b> = (Total Watt needed) / (12Volts) //(Since this is most commonly used)
<p><b>Panel Power Size</b> = (Total Watt needed by devices) / (Hours of sunlight in the region)
 
<p><h2>Stages and processes of using our solar calculator app..</h2></p> 
<p><b>1:</b></p>
