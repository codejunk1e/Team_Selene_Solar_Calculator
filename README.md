<p><h2>Here's the algorithm/calculations adopted..</h2></p>

<p><b>Watt</b> = Voltage * Amps 
<p><b>Total watt needed for device</b> = (Voltage) * (Amps) * (Hours Used daily)
<p><b>Battery size(AH)</b> = (Total Watt needed) / (12Volts) //(Since this is most commonly used)
<p><b>Panel Power Size</b> = (Total Watt needed by devices) / (Hours of sunlight in the region)
